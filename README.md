## 5 minutes of fame

Ya boi is technically a GitHub dev!
All I did was fix a parenthesis on their website but...
https://github.com/github/docs/pull/11652
merged into main and live in the last paragraph at

## RANKED LEGENDS: Where accessible collides with mind-blowing (AKA what my demos dream of being when they grow up)

Stein, Charles (1956): Inadmissibility of the Usual Estimator for the Mean of a Multivariate Normal Distribution. Published in the Proceedings of the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability. [link](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~hz68/619/Stein-1956.pdf), [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210427023010/http://www.stat.yale.edu/~hz68/619/Stein-1956.pdf). Satirical abstract: Stein shows that "Michael has 4 apples, his train is 7 minutes early, calculate the mass of the sun" is actually a legitimate exam question.

Neal, Radford (2008): Inconsistent Maximum Likelihood Estimation: An "Ordinary" Example. Published on his blog. [link](https://radfordneal.wordpress.com/2008/08/09/inconsistent-maximum-likelihood-estimation-an-ordinary-example/), [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523062301/https://radfordneal.wordpress.com/2008/08/09/inconsistent-maximum-likelihood-estimation-an-ordinary-example/). Satirical abstract: Okay MLE, I gave you the benefit of the doubt with GMM's, but what possible excuse could you have for _this_?
