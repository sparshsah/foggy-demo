# Realized Sharpe Ratios of Some Major Funds

As always, these suffer from survivorship bias --
I wouldn't be writing about them if they hadn't performed well.
It's not possible to know with certainty how much of that good performance
was attributable to true goodness, and how much to dumb luck.
Even with that luck sprinkled on, notice that none is 2+!
It is very hard to kill it at capacity.

Sources for each of these figures are stored in `./files`.
