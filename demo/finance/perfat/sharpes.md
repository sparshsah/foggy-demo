# Realized Sharpe Ratios of Some Major Funds

As always, these suffer from survivorship bias --
I wouldn't be writing about them if they hadn't performed well.
It's not possible to know with certainty how much of that good performance
was attributable to true goodness, and how much to dumb luck.
Even with that luck sprinkled on, notice that none is 2+!
It is very hard to kill it at capacity.

Also, definitely don't interpret this as a ranking of go-forward goodness.
Although most of these histories are long enough to reject the hypothesis that
an individual's ER is zero (to get the t-stat, just multiply the annualized Sharpe by
the square root of the length of the review period in years --
and don't tell your Stats prof that you're ignoring the multiple-hypotheses correction),
none of them is long enough to confidently conclude that any one has a
higher or lower Sharpe than any other one.
And on top of that, the choice of time period, which just came down to whatever sources I could find,
makes a huge difference. Two Sigma's ARP fund was incepted in 2015, and my review ended in 2021.
The 2018-2020 period (the so-called "Quant Winter") was infamously tough for ARP,
and so its tepid Sharpe of 0.14 is in some sense unfair.
They just happened to launch at an unlucky time, but I have extreme conviction
(in a non-financial-advice way)
that the strategy over the long term will achieve a Sharpe closer to 0.60,
and based on this conviction I remain invested in a similar fund elsewhere.

To that point, the ostensible winner based on the numbers below, DE Shaw's Composite fund,
shit the bed so hard during the GFC that they had to lay off 10\% of their staff in one day.
People wondered aloud whether the firm was long for this Earth, and then Composite went on to post
a decade of great performance, and everyone immediately forgot about the first thing,
and now they're all clamoring to pay 4-and-40 to get into a fund that in 2009
they were battering down the gates to get out of ([ref](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2btgdofw34j872f1b8fls/premium/d-e-shaw-opens-gates-expects-3-3-billion-to-flee-magazine-version)).
