    "* Across every $t$, $\\text{Corr}(X_{t+1},\\, X_{t})$ is some constant. Notice that $(X_{t+1},\\, X_t)$ are unconditionally jointly distributed as MVN with zero mean and a nontrivial correlation matrix. So, any linear combination thereof is Normal. Let's call the difference $\\Delta X_{t+1} := X_{t+1} - X_t$ distributed as $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu := 0,\\, \\sigma := \\delta)$.\n",

    "Let's diversify our strategy, so that we have a new signal (note: because the signals have the same Sharpe, this happens to be the MVO weighting) $Z_t := \\frac{1}{2}X_t + \\frac{1}{2}Y_t$. Actually, for reasons that will become clear in a moment, let's make our new signal\n",
    "$$ Z_t := \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}X_t + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}Y_t .$$\n",
    "What is the distribution of $Z_t$? Well, its mean is clearly zero (it's the sum of two zero-mean RV's!). And an elementary calculation shows that its standard deviation is unity. Therefore,\n",
    "$$ X_t \\cong Z_t \\cong Y_t ,$$\n",
    "that is, $Z_t$ is equivalent in distribution to each of its constituents. Hence it must have the same statistics as its constituents, and in particular takes the *same expected leverage*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people find this unintuitive: The strategy is diversified, they reason, and so we know we must scale it up to hit the same risk, in particular multiplying the space-average signal by $\\sqrt{2}$ (that's what we did when modifying the $\\frac{1}{2}$ to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$). Shouldn't its time-average leverage therefore also scale up by $\\sqrt{2}$? This misses the key point: The reason we must scale up the strategy, is that its volatility has shrunk. Equivalently, the time-average leverage the strategy takes in $A$ has shrunk. After all, volatility is proportional to leverage, and vice versa! Just like the risk, the leverage has been partly \"diversified away\". We scale up the strategy to hit the same time-average leverage, and thus the same risk, as before.\n",
