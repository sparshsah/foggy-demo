    "#### Commentary\n",
    "\n",
    "I've set these numbers to be actually realistic, so that there is a genuine tradeoff. (If there weren't, the anomalous profits to this strategy would probably be quickly arb'ed away -- No pain, no gain. The fact that factors can experience drawdowns that make them hard to stick with is ironically probably a desirable feature, as it scares people away from arb'ing away the mispricing.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* In expectation, the third alternative ends at $\\$121$, higher than A's $\\$120$ and much higher than B's $\\$112$.\n",
    "* In the bear case, the third alternative ends at $\\$105$, much higher than A's $\\$100$ and also higher than B's $\\$104$.\n",
    "* In the bull case, the third alternative ends at $\\$137$, not quite as high as A's $\\$140$ but much higher than B's $\\$120$.\n",
    "* In a 100-year flood, the third alternative ends at $\\$57$, much lower than A's $\\$70$ and much _much_ lower than B's $\\$80$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what would you choose? A, B, or juiced B? If you're on the fence, what if you redo the exercise but assume taking only 1.5x leverage in B? This will kill your ER advantage over A, but you'll still have a meaningful ER advantage over unlevered B, and will still be much safer than A."

    "First of all, note that maintaining leverage over some given horizon requires you to dynamically rebalance to target.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose SPXL, Direxion's Daily 3x-Levered Bull SPX ETF, has USD1 NAV (USD1 client assets + USD2 borrowed money - USD2 owed on the loan), and hence invests USD3 in the SP500. Then suppose today the SP500 return 1pct (assume zero interest rates), growing SPXL's NAV to USD1.03.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means Direxion must go back to the bank and borrow an additional USD0.06, because now (assuming they didn't buy or sell any of the shares, meaning that conveniently their holdings naturally evolved to reflect the new composition of the SP500, which is a convenient feature of market-cap-weighted benchmarks and indeed a cornerstone of truly \"passive\" investment strategies) they are technically at 2.94x=USD3.03/USD1.03 leverage which is slightly less than their 3x stated target."

    "Second of all, take a look at the below. Levering up to 1.20x seems like a good tradeoff: If you consistently win, you overall win fully 1.473x as much; whereas if you consistently lose, you overall lose only 1.068x as much. But levering down to 0.80x seems like a bad tradeoff: If you consistently win, you overall win only 0.657x as much; whereas if you consistently lose, you overall lose fully 0.905x as much. Note that the \"contrapositive\" therefore also holds: Based on this logic, levering up from 0.80x to 1.00x seems like a good tradeoff. The upshot is that deleveraging as a risk-reduction tactic might dampen your wins more than expected, while simultaneously dampening your losses less than expected.\n",
