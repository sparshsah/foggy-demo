# Risk and Diversification

Cliff's [#1 Peeve](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/My-Top-10-Peeves) is
"Volatility Is for Misguided Geeks; Risk Is Really the Chance of a Permanent Loss of Capital".
I'll let him explain why that's a peeve.
(Spoiler alert: It's about reward-per-unit-of-uncertainty, especially in the presence of leverage.)
But here's two hypotheticals for stalwarts on the other side.

## How do you take your 10% annualized loss expectancy, sir?

Say you have $100 to invest. Would you prefer:
* Putting $50 into one 10% ALE project, and the other $50 into another 10% ALE project; or,
* Putting $50 into one 20% ALE project, and the other $50 into a 0% ALE project?

## Do black swans swim alike?

Say you have $100 to invest. Would you prefer:
* Lending $50 to a teacher in New York City to finance a first-time home mortgage, and then
    lending the other $50 to another teacher in New York City to finance _her_ first-time home mortgage; or,
* Lending $50 to a teacher in New York City to finance a first-time home mortgage, and then
    lending the other $50 to a retired software developer in San Francisco to finance a new car; or,
* Lending $50 to a retired software developer in San Francisco to finance a new car, and then
    lending the other $50 to another retired software developer in San Francisco to finance _her_ new car?
