They can be totally ignorant of each other and still come up with the optimal combined portfolio when taken together.\n",

    "* Second of all, more mundane, is tax efficiencies. To see why separating alpha from beta usually results in more favorable taxable gains, see my [writeup on alphaports](https://github.com/sparshsah/foggy-demo/blob/main/demo/finance/alphaport.ipynb). But the best of all (just from a tax standpoint) would be to run an SMA alphaport structure with the same manager, and allow cross-trading. This gives maximum flexibility."
