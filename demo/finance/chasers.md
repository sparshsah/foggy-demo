# Why I Distrust Performance-Chasing

Cliff Asness says, "Don't be a momentum investor at a value time horizon".
What he means is: Momentum tends to be a jumpy, short-term phenomenon --
Don't pick a stock/factor/manager based on 3-5-year recent returns.
First of all, it should go without saying that you should be disciplined
and stick to a long-term plan supported by evidence.
But, if anything, you probably want to be _contrarian_ versus 3-5-year recent returns.

## Crowding

When a trend develops, it attracts people.
We call this "herding" or "bandwagon effect".
The outcome can be "crowding", which is the imprecise idea that
a certain stock or portfolio of stocks is "too popular".
More concretely, there are two phenomena we want to avoid. 

### Part I: Richened Valuations

If you front-run the trend, then the herd that comes after you benefits you by
putting upward pressure on the price of your stock.
At this point, you might want to sell and "take profits".

But if you're at the _back_ of the herd, then you are buying the stock at
the upward-pressured prices.
The fear is that the herd may have driven the price _irrationally_ high.
The simplest symptom is that the stock now looks unattractive when you consider
B/P or E/P or whatever other VALue/High-Minus-Low metric you prefer.

This phenomenon is the easiest to diagnose, because you can simply
observe the numerator and denominator and calculate the ratio.

### Part II: Fire-Exit Risk

Whereas Part I was about ER (Expected Returns),
Part II is about Risk (Uncertainty).
The risk here is... Well, another
[Quant Crisis](https://github.com/sparshsah/foggy-demo/blob/main/demo/finance/syllabus/fin-syll.pdf).

## Mean-Reversion

This is one is hand-wavey. But it gets exactly at the heart of Cliff's quote.
Stylized wisdom is that stock/factor performance tends to be "sticky" or "trendy" at short horizons,
but mean-reverting at medium horizons.
If a stock or index or factor has outperformed over the last 3-5 years, it may be overextended.
On the other hand, if it has _underperformed_, it may be "due" for a return to form.
(One mechanism for this could be exactly the Richened-Valuation effect I described above.
You could attempt to diagnose how "due" the stock by looking at your favorite value metric.
But even just straight-up "5-year reversal" is itself and on its own a
moderately-popular VALue signal in the factor literature!)
