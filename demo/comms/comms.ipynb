    "Take for granted that we can generate a photon of a given frequency $f$. We can transmit this photon to be a radio wave. By transmitting a simultaneous burst of many such photons at once, we increase the amplitude of this radio wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locally, we reserve a narrow frequency band for ourselves. But nearby operators are simultaneously transmitting on their own frequencies. The result is a cacophony of overlapping frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to \"tune in\" to the specific frequency we're interested in (and \"ignore\" or _attenuate_ all the others), we need a tuner. For this purpose, a tuner acts as a bandpass filter. A simple kind of tuner is an LC circuit, which is \"activated\" only by photons at the circuit's resonant frequency. It is to light waves what a tuning fork is to sound waves. It picks out just the photons of our desired frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apparently construct a rudimentary LC circuit by just coiling copper wire into even coils! I must try this."
