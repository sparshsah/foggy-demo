# Why Gravity is not Truly Quantum

Sorry, but it's just too different from the other three interactions (EM, Strong, and Weak).

## What I mean

First let's agree that, by default, when I refer to mass or energy,
I am referring not to the "rest" or "invariant" contribution,
but to the "relativistic" or "total" measurable amount.
An old version of my argument got stuck in the weeds of "kinds" of
[mass](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v11/118) --
Higgs rest mass vs non-Higgs rest mass vs non-rest mass.
I got advice that, in the context of my argument,
breaking out these contributions just muddies the waters
and pulls in irrelevant deeper questions.

Now, I am going to call the three "Standard Model" interactions (EM, Strong, and Weak)
"truly quantum". By "an interaction is truly quantum", I mean that
(a) We can characterize it as being mediated by a force-carrier boson field, and
(b) We can experimentally detect excitations of said field as real particles.

Obviously, for gravity to be "truly quantum", it is not enough that
gravity-like effects arise when you add a certain term to a some differential equation,
and this term looks like it corresponds to a hypothesized graviton field.
For this to be complete, we need that
(a) Gravitational phenomena are fully-explained by this field, and
(b) We can detect the quanta of this field.

Therefore, I say: We have photons, gluons, and W/Z bosons; But we will never have a graviton.

## The Why's

### 1. Energy-Mass Equivalence

Energy---in any form---sums up to inertial mass,
which is identical to gravitational mass.

The first thing---energy---is spiritually emergent:
The Higgs gives (and has) energy, photons have energy (but zero rest energy),
protons have a lot more rest energy than electrons but very little of that is due to the Higgs,
hot tea has more energy than cold tea.

The second thing---inertia---is spiritually fundamental to _any_ theory of mechanics.

The last thing---gravitational charge---well, that's what we're arguing about.

That all these three things are (as far as we've been able to measure)
equivalent is just too much of a coincidence.

It reminds me of Jerry Bona's joke:
"The Axiom of Choice is obviously true, the wellâ€“ordering theorem is obviously false, and who can tell about Zorn's Lemma?".

In fact, it's not just a coincidence and a joke, it's also a paradox:
Inertia, the thing that resists forces, hereby also... causes a force.
So the coincidence leads to a paradox.

In fact, it doesn't just stop there!
The paradox itself leads to yet another coincidence, that of Galileo's falling balls.

I submit:
- Gravity involves a coincidence that reminds me of a joke and leads to a paradox
- Nothing involving a coincidence that reminds me of a joke and leads to a paradox can be Truly Quantum

Therefore:
- Gravity is not Truly Quantum, QED.
  (That's, err, "Quod Erat Demonstrandum", not "Quantum Electro-Dynamics".)

### 2. Gravity and the Geometry of Spacetime

Lensing and LIGO's detection of gravitationally-induced spacetime distortions
prove once-and-for-all that gravity is a geometric, not a particulate, phenomenon.
