Sorry, but it's just too different from the other three interactions (EM, Strong, and Weak).

0. The Higgs field endows fundamental particles with rest mass.
   And rest mass contributes to gravitational charge.
   So, the Higgs field endows fundamental particles with gravitational charge.
   Contrariwise, we do not hypothesize a "Electro-Higgs" field that endows particles with EM charge,
   or a "Strong Higgs" field that endows particles with color,
   or hypercharge, or isospin, or any other quantum charge.
1. Energy---any kind of energy, even just random kinetic energy as indicated by high temperature---contributes
   to gravitational charge. Quarks' and leptons' rest mass is a tiny minority of the mass of an atom.
   Gluons, the Strong force, chromodynamics, and confinement contribute the vast majority.
   Wait a minute... the Strong force gives rise to gravitational charge? WTF?
   And... photons, by virtue of their incredible kinetic energy, have gravitational charge...
   So, err, the electromagnetic force (or, at least, real excitations of the field
   corresponding to the carrier virtual boson that mediates it) has gravitational charge? WTFF?
   And, uhh, the Weak bosons straight-up _have_ rest mass? WTFFF?
3. (Relativistic) inertial mass is the same as gravitational charge.
   So inertia, the thing that resists forces... causes force.
   Hence we end up with the all-too-convenient coincidence of Galileo's falling balls.
   (One was heavy and one was light, which is perfectly normal.)
4. Lensing and LIGO's detection of gravitationally-induced spacetime distortions
   prove once-and-for-all that gravity is a geometric, not a particulate, phenomenon.
