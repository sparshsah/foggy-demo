    "So he says: If Allie's results are positive, there's no need for any further action.\n",
    "But, if her results are inconclusive (null), then he will take it upon himself\n",
    "to be resourceful and do a followup study replicating her experiment.\n",

    "Note: This superficially looks like Chuck's invalid method from above,\n",
    "but the important thing is that David doesn't discard Allie's data even if it comes out null.\n",
    "He retains it, and directly pools hers with his.\n",
    "So, he's in some sense already handicapping himself out the gate\n",
    "by forcing himself to mix in results that he has already observed to be null."
